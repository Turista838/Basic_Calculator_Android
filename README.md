# Basic_Calculator_Android

### Project developed for 'Mobile Architectures', a third year subject @ISEC

This is my first project for Android, where I tested the knowledge I gained from 6 hours of classes, like:
* Android Studio Setup
* Kotlin language
* Resources (drawables, layouts, values,...)
* Events processing
